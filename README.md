## Hi, I am Marta ðŸ‘‹

I wrote my first line of code in March 2020. 
I have found it interesting and dived into the vast world of frontend development. 
What I particularly like about frontend is that I can create things from scratch and see the results of my work. 
It also means **constant process of learning and improving myself**.

### Currently, I am working on improving JavaScript and React skills.
